# Vanilla JS Navigation

**Vanilla JS Navigation** is a lightweight web application built with plain JavaScript and Parcel as the bundler. It features a dynamic navigation system with synchronized navigation effects, an infinite carousel displaying navigation items, and client-side routing using the History API. The project also includes options to disable animations.

## Features

- **Header Navigation**: Provides navigation links at the top of the page.
- **Footer Navigation**: Includes navigation links at the bottom of the page, with synchronized effects affecting both header and footer when navigating.
- **Infinite Carousel**: Displays navigation items in an endlessly looping carousel with smooth animation.
- **Animation Controls**: Allows users to enable or disable animations for a customizable experience.
- **Client-Side Routing**: Utilizes the History API for client-side routing, enabling smooth transitions between different views without full page reloads.
- **Mock Content**: All other content on the page is placeholder or mock content.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
